My code in books

During a "vanity search" of this blog "btbytes.github.io", I found out that some of my code have been quoted in published books:

([A Particle Swarm Optimization](https://gist.github.com/btbytes/79877)) implementation in Python in ["Intelligent IoT Projects in 7 Days"](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/intelligent-iot-projects-7-days). I remember writing this code for Dr Eberhart's "Computation Intelligence" class at IUPUI.
