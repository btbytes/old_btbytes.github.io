A worked exmaple of - A persian folk method of figuring interest

I found the paper ["A persian folk method of figuring interest"](https://twitter.com/docmilanfar/status/1254535223733186560) via Dr Peyman Milanfar on twitter, where he described this method as the one deployed by his father to quickly calculate the monthly payments on a home loan.

I thought it is a good idea to do a workout of the formula myself so that I can remember it:

For this demonstration, let's consider a loan amount (Principal) of $10,000 for a period of 4 years(48 months) at an interest rate of 7% pa.

Step 1: calculate the interest amount over the loan period

	Interest = 0.5 * Principal * Number of years * Annual Interest Rate
	Interest = 0.5 * 10000 * 4 * 0.07
	Interest = 1400.0

Step 2: calculate the Monthly Payment

	Monthly Payment = (Principal + Interest) / (Number of Months)
	Monthly Payment = (10000 + 1400.0) / 48
	Monthly Payment = 237.5


Applying the actual mortagage formula for Monthly Payment (`C`) is:

	C = r * (1 + r )^N * P / ((1 + r )^N - 1)

where,

	r = monthly interest rate => 0.07 / 12
	N = total number of months => 48
	P = principal => 10,000

therefore we have,

	C = 239.46

The shortcut method is a very good approximation of the true calculation, and it is made of simple arithmetic operations available on any handheld calculator / phone.

This is surprisingly handy when you are at a negotiating table (eg: Car purchase). This is the kind of mentral tricks that are really useful in the "real world". Try it out.
