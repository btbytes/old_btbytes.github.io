Sustainable tech by The Rabbits

Came across [The Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/about_us.html) via [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23211273). Two tech folks who are building stuff  in the way of "resilience and self-reliance using low-tech solutions.". They appear to building most of their stuff in [C99, ASM and JS](https://100r.co/site/philosophy.html#accessibility).

Their [Ronin](https://100r.co/site/ronin.html) project implements a browser based lisp interpreter, which can be used for making generative art. You can play with a program in [the playground](https://hundredrabbits.github.io/Ronin/). 

[Dotgrid](https://100r.co/site/dotgrid.html) is  a grid-based vector drawing software designed to create logos, icons and type. Like their applications, being able to drive the program with keystrokes seems like a feature I'd like to explore. I'm a total dummy when it comes to vector graphics. The simplicity of this tool might help exploration and learning.

[Orca](https://100r.co/site/orca.html) immediately brought to my mind [Colorforth](https://colorforth.github.io) by Charles Moore. 

Their minimalistic, prose-writing oriented editor [Left](https://100r.co/site/left.html) makes me write my own text editor. I donated $5 and downloaded Left.
