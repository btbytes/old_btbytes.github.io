A few interesting things

[entr](http://eradman.com/entrproject/) is nice tool to add to the repertoire of 
scripting and make files. One of the examples given on that page is to use this
program to watch over HTML+CSS file when you are editing one. I am thinking of using this to create a kind of "markdown live editor", which uses pandoc to render markdown to html.

I posted a [gerbil scheme](https://cons.io) to [lobst.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/c29wn2/gerbil_scheme) where the creator of [Fennel Lang](https://fennel-lang.org/) posted a link which lead to this [rich makefile](https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/fennel-lang.org/tree/master/makefile) which is worthy of studying. 

For instance, this line: `reference.html: fennel/reference.md ; $(PANDOC) --toc -o $@ $^`. I believe this means I can write one line "actions" followed by semi-colon.


The other thing that Makefile reminded me of is the `--lua-filter`. Pandoc ships with a lua interpreter, which makes it easy to write post processing filters without needing an additional software installed (eg: for python, you still need some kind Pandoc library).

*Each Lua filter must contain element-transforming functions indexed by the name of the AST element on which the filter function should be applied.*

*The pandoc Lua module provides helper functions for element creation. It is always loaded into the script’s Lua environment.*

*The following is an example Lua script for macro-expansion:*

```lua
function expand_hello_world(inline)
  if inline.c == '{{helloworld}}' then
    return pandoc.Emph{ pandoc.Str "Hello, World" }
  else
    return inline
  end
end

return {{Str = expand_hello_world}}
```


Important thing to remember from above snippet:

Make sure you are "indexing" the functions by the AST element (above, the function `expand_hello_world` is indexed to `Str` AST element type).

Data science courses of Dr Michael Guerzhoy at Princeton [SML201](http://guerzhoy.princeton.edu/201s20/) has good intro material based on R.

Started using [bbedit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) more.I even configured the scripts that help me in editing this blog to use bbedit directly.  I really like (much like Textwrangler's) ability to "Untitled" buffers as a quick way to start writing without worrying about losing them if I close the editor without saving them to a file.
