Just-what-you-need blogging with bari

I write this blog using a combination of `pandoc`, `make` and a small-ish python script called [bari](https://github.com/btbytes/bari). 

It is easy for me to design, write and maintain my own code than inherit someone else's assumptions and "wants" for their software.

I saw another blog [https://blog.notryan.com/](https://blog.notryan.com/) that is also written in a similar spirit -- uses only C, and a bash script to generate a "text only" blog and RSS feed.

So, go on, write your own little program(s) to do what you need to get writing. Some of it is yak-shaving; but some yaks are small, some of you are expert shavers. You will figure it out.
