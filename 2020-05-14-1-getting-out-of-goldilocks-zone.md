Getting Out of the Programming Goldilocks Zone

As a programmer, I have my [goldilocks zone](2020-05-06-06-happy-python.html) (Python).

In order to reach for a different language, I'll expect to get comfortable doing the following things in a new language:

* string manipulation - split, join etc
* string formatting and printing
* string templating
* reading and writing to files
* iterating over the contents of a file
* json parsing and generation
* reading and writing csv files
* regular expressions
* command line arguments and parsing them
* http client operations - GET, POST
* reading configurations from a file - toml, yaml, ini
* processing xml files
* generating HTML files
* dealing with unicode encoding
* unit testing
* connecting to and querying sql databases
* shelling out and calling external processes
* threads
* multiprocessing
* asynchronous programming
* using third party code and library
* packaging code for reuse
* packaging binaries for deployment
* cross-platform compilation
