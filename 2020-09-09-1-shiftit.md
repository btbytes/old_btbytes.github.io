Hammerspoon ShiftIt Window Manager

In the past I've used [Spectacle App](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)[^1], for managing windows on Mac OS. 

As of today, I have shifted to using [Hammerspoon Shiftit](https://github.com/peterklijn/hammerspoon-shiftit) a configuration for [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) which gives me same functionality without having to use yet another app (I already have Hammerspoon installed and Hammerspoon is a powerful automation tool which can be programmed using the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) programming language. )

[^1]: the development of Spectacle continues under a new name -- [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle).
