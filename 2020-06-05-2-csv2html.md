csv2html

Today, I had to create a paste a table of values into a JIRA ticket and I had a csv file. There are different ways to "paste" a nicely formatted table into a JIRA WYSIWYG text area, I'm sure.. but none of them fast enough to type: `$csv2html source.csv destation.html`. So, I wrote one.

You can find it here [https://github.com/btbytes.csv2html](https://github.com/btbytes.csv2html). The help is self explanatory: 

```$./csv2html.py -h
usage: csv2html.py [-h] [--delimiter DELIMITER] [--quotechar QUOTECHAR]
                   [--title TITLE] [--caption CAPTION] [--header]
                   csvfile

CSV to HTML converter.

positional arguments:
  csvfile

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --delimiter DELIMITER
                        Field delimiter. Default is , .
  --quotechar QUOTECHAR
                        Quote Character. Deault is nothing
  --title TITLE         Page title. Will be printed in h1 tag.
  --caption CAPTION     Table caption.
  --header              data has header. First row will be "th".
```

Ideally, I'd have liked to use the [pandoc-csv2table](https://github.com/baig/pandoc-csv2table) pandoc filter. But, installing this filter using `cabal` and `stack` turned out to be disappointing. So instead of figuring out how to compile and install these Haskell packages, I wrote this script. 

I can still do some improvements to this script, like:

a. adding an `-o --output` flag to write the output to a file instead of stdout. 
b. override the css


But, that's for another day.
