Quip

[Quip] from Salesforce looks like "Jupyter notebooks" for sales and service workers.

I came across this site while reading [The Best Medium-Hard Data Analyst SQL Interview Questions  ](https://quip.com/2gwZArKuWk7W). Looking at this document and the "tour", it appears to be a turbo charged "Word" / Google Docs more than full fledged data analytics platform. 

I have never used "Sharepoint", so I can't compare it to that. 

There is no "free tier" to try out.
