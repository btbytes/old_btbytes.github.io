Some interesting things

[Your Makefiles are wrong](https://tech.davis-hansson.com/p/make/) taught me some good tricks about writing make files.

"Move slow and make things." -- \@stevelosh (on his twitter profile). I often think about that.

Steve's [A Road to Common Lisp](https://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/) is an excellent article that captures some of his thought process behind that "motto". I particularly like the "*Escaping the Hamster Wheel of Backwards Incompatibility*" section.

If you desire to make things that are solving *unusual* and *novel* things, and you see the things you build last for years, if not decades, you *have* consider what technologies you put your time into. Steve chose Common Lisp, and I think its a solid choice.

[Deno](https://deno.land) 1.0 [was announced today](https://deno.land/v1). I've long ignored node.js, and the ecosystem around it primarily because I think the situation around `node_modules` is ridiculous. My hope for deno is that it can become a replacement for Python (and Go) for many tasks.

Common Lisp things:

Using a portacle instance instead of trying to configure my emacs installation to avoid [*the Omnibus configuration pattern*](https://twitter.com/btbytes/status/1259890526242983939).

Trying to familiarize myself with [str](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-str/) library. 

Common characters:

	#\Space #\Newline #\Backspace #\Tab #\Linefeed #\Page #\Return

Spelled out: "Hash-Backslash-NAME" - `#\Space`.
